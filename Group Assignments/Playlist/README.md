## Programming workshop - Playlist Mini-Project

This is a simple Java program that uses a few classes to manage genres of songs (which are collections of tracks) and then optionally create / add them into a playlist (which is global) which then can be displayed and shuffled. It demonstrates a good understanding of map/list based data structures in Java by collecting track names using HashMap/ArrayList. In production, these would typically be more advanced collections of secondary structures such as an individualized Track class, however it is not necessary in this simple implementation.
