## How It Works

### **Core Functionalities**
1. **Explore Locations**:
   - Players start in a random location and can choose actions to perform.
   - Locations include:
     - Beach
     - Mountain
     - Cave
     - Ocean

2. **Perform Actions**:
   - Each location offers unique actions like "Dig in the sand" or "Inspect the glowing rock."
   - Actions lead to outcomes such as discovering clues, treasures, or even monsters.

3. **Find the Treasure**:
   - Players aim to uncover the ultimate treasure hidden on the island.
   - The game ends when the treasure is found or all locations are explored.

4. **Dynamic Storyline**:
   - Outcomes of actions influence the next steps, guiding players to new locations or keeping them in the current one.

### **Key Components**
- **Locations and Actions**:
  - Managed using a `HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>>`, where each location maps to a list of possible actions.
- **Outcomes**:
  - Defined using a `HashMap<String, String>`, mapping actions to outcomes (e.g., "Find the summit" â†’ "You find a treasure chest on top of the mountains.").
- **Visited Locations**:
  - Tracked using a `HashSet<String>` to ensure each location is explored.

## Example Gameplay
1. **Start the Game**:
   - A random location is assigned, e.g., "You are at the Beach."
2. **Choose Actions**:
   - Example:
     ```
     1. Look under the palm tree
     2. Dig in the sand
     3. Walk along the shore
     4. Head north
     ```
   - Enter a choice, and the corresponding outcome is displayed.
3. **Uncover Clues**:
   - Example outcome: "You found a map pointing to the Mountain!"
4. **Find the Treasure**:
   - Example: "You find a treasure chest on top of the mountains. Congratulations!"
